## Get started with LeadDesk 5

Follow these steps to upload your first CSV and monitor the enrichment process.

### Step 1: Prepare Your CSV

Create a CSV file with practice identifiers (URLs or IDs), one per line.

```csv
practice_identifier
https://example-practice1.com
https://example-practice2.com
https://example-practice3.com
```

<Tip>Each row should contain a practice website URL or unique identifier.</Tip>

### Step 2: Upload Your Batch

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to New Job">
    Go to `/jobs/new` in the LeadDesk 5 interface.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Upload CSV">
    Drag and drop your CSV file or click to browse. The system will validate and preview the first 5 rows.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Job">
    Click "Create Job" to start processing. You'll be redirected to the job detail page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Monitor Progress

The job detail page automatically polls for updates every 3 seconds.

You'll see:
- **Job Status** - Overall job state (pending → processing → completed)
- **Progress Bar** - Visual representation of completion
- **Practice Table** - Individual practice status and errors

<Info>
  Polling stops automatically when the job reaches `completed` or `failed` status.
</Info>

### Step 4: Export Results

Once the job is complete:

1. Click the **Export CSV** button on the job detail page
2. Download your enriched data with all aggregated fields
3. Review practice results including any errors

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Job Creation">
    Your CSV is parsed and stored in the `enrichment_jobs` and `job_practices` tables.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Workflow Dispatch">
    The n8n Dispatcher workflow is triggered to process practices in batches.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Worker Processing">

  </Step>
